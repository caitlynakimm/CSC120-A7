- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- I liked how simple it was to inherit the superclass's (Building's) constructor and that I could add onto it for the House, Library, and Cafe constructors. It saved time and kept the code clear. I also liked that I could write the call signatures for the instances in Cafe, Libary, and House the name of the classes instead of Building.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- I think what worked was creating the constructors for the House, Library, and Cafe classes and basic methods that were accessors. But, what didn't work or took more time were the more complex methods that required thinking about the different scenarios that could happen like the checkOut(), returnBook(), and sellCoffee() or that dealt with formatting like printCollection(). Advice I would give is think about the basic conditions/scenarios that could occur for each method before you start coding, and then build off of those scenarios.
